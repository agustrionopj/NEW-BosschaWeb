abstract: "With over 80 years of existence, Bosscha Observatory in Lembang, West Java, Indonesia, still stands as one of the largest observatories that is registered by International Astronomical Union in the South East Asia region. Since first commissioned by the NISV (Netherlands Indische Sterrenkundige Vereeniging), Bosscha Observatory had played a major role in astronomy, particularly in research and observational activities in the southern hemisphere. But the current development has produced a serious impact on Bosscha Observatory, both tangible and intangible. With the challenges Bosscha Observatory faced the past decades, what can be done in the future to conserve not only the tangible value but most importantly the intangible value it embraces for the scientific development? This paper emphasizes its values, and opens some perspectives and ideas for conserving a (candidate to) Astronomy and World Heritage site. This important issue of how to best preserve the scientific value of this scientific heritage it embodied is discussed in some detail."
