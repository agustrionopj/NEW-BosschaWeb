 abstract = {Strong gravitationally lensed quasars provide powerful means to study galaxy evolution and cosmology. We use Chitah to hunt for new lens systems in the Hyper Suprime\$-\$Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) S16A. We present 46 lens candidates, of which 3 are previously known. Including 2 additional lenses found by YattaLens, we obtain X-shooter spectra of 6 promising candidates for lens confirmation and redshift measurements. We report new spectroscopic redshift measurements for both the lens and source galaxies in 4 lens systems. We apply the lens modeling software Glee to model our 6 X-shooter lenses uniformly. Through our analysis of the HSC images, we find that HSCJ022622\$-\$042522, HSCJ115252\$+\$004733, and HSCJ141136\$-\$010216 have point-like lensed images, and that the lens light distribution is well aligned with mass distribution within 6 deg. Thanks to the X-shooter spectra, we estimate fluxes on the Baldwin- Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, and find that HSCJ022622\$-\$042522 has a probable quasar source, based on the upper limit of the Nii flux intensity. We also measure the FWHM of Ly\$\alpha\$ emission of HSCJ141136\$-\$010216 to be \$\sim\$254 km/s, showing that it is a probable Lyman-\$\alpha\$ emitter.},
