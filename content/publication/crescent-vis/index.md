abstract: "In this paper we present the prediction of the first lunar crescent visibility using contrast based on Schaefer's model and best time proposed by [12] for the beginning of Ramadhan and Syawal 1431 H at observing place in Bosscha Observatory, [E 107째 36.96', S 6째 49.55', with elevation of 1310 meters above sea level]. The geocentric altitude of the Moon at the sunset time on August 10 is 1째 58.98' and illuminated fraction of crescent (FI) = 0.20%. On August 11, 2010 the altitude of the Moon at the sunset time is 15째 42.71' and FI = 2.57%. The calculated contrast on August 10, 2010 is less than zero. It means that the brightness of the moon is smaller than brightness of the sky. Based on the contrast value, it is impossible to observe the lunar crescent by the naked eye at that time, even equipped by special design telescope for the crescent observation at Bosscha Observatory. Sultan [11] proposed a predicted model it is still possible to observe the very young lunar crescent even under circumstance before the time of sunset, if the contrast of sky is perfect. On August 11, 2010 contrast has its maximum at 50 minutes after sunset. The result of observation of the lunar crescent at Bosscha Observatory, the crescent could be seen before sunset at 17:15 local time (UT+7 hours) using special design telescope with additional nose of 1 meter length [6]. The model used here is tend to predict the brightness for naked eye observation, which less contrast compare to observation with the well design telescope."
