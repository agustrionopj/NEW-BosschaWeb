abstract: "UU Aqr is a nova-like cataclysmic variable whose variability was found spectroscopically by Volkov et al. (1985). Since its discovery, UU Aqr shows various activities yet cannot be explained. In this paper we present an overview of the system's uniqueness and recent results of its photometric observations carried out at Bosscha Observatory (Lembang, Indonesia)."
