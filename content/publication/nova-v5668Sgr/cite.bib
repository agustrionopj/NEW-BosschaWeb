	abstract = {The spectral evolution of the Nova V5668 Sgr has been observed on 12 June, 23 June, and 15 August 2015 using NEO-R1000 spectrograph attached to the C-11 telescope at Bosscha Observatory, Lembang, Indonesia. The observed spectra indicate that the nova has been entering the nebular phase. The spectra during this phase showed strong forbidden lines of [O I] λ6300, 6364, [O II] λ7320, and [O III] λ5007, [N II] λ5755. The spectra also showed emission line of Fe II λ4924, 5169, 5317, 6149. We classify Nova V5668 Sgr into the Fe II type. We present and discuss the variation of nebular abundance N(X)/N(H) of the Nova V5668 Sgr in the light of its evolutionary stages.}
