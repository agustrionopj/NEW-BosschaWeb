 abstract = {We performed an investigation of the possibility of constraining the dark energy models such as w-cold dark matter, holographic dark energy, and Ricci dark energy, using a special type of Einstein ring system, called as double-source plane (DSP) lensing system. We found that DSP lensing system only gives a good constraint of the model parameters. We also found that the method highly complimentary to cosmic microwave background measurement for each model.},
