abstract: "We present new CCD photometric observation of V899 Herculis system which obtained in May-June 2010 at Bosscha Observatory ITB, Lembang Indonesia, using the 20.3 cm(f/10.0) Schmidt-Cassegrain GAO-ITB RTS telescope equipped with ST8 CCD camera. We secure 1 time of primary minimum. We employed Cubic Fit method tep{bre1973} to make minimum timing and define the primary minima. Discussion on the nature of V899 Her based on new O-C diagram analysis will be presented."
