 abstract = {We present a new catalog of \$9318\$ Ly\$\alpha\$ emitter (LAE) candidates at \$z = 2.2\$, \$3.3\$, \$4.9\$, \$5.7\$, \$6.6\$, and \$7.0\$ that are photometrically selected by the SILVERRUSH program with a machine learning technique from large area (up to \$25.0\$ deg\$\textasciicircum2\$) imaging data with six narrowband filters taken by the Subaru Strategic Program with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC SSP) and a Subaru intensive program, Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS). We construct a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between real LAEs and contaminants with a completeness of \$94\$% and a contamination rate of \$1\$%, enabling us to efficiently remove contaminants from the photometrically selected LAE candidates. We confirm that our LAE catalogs include \$177\$ LAEs that have been spectroscopically identified in our SILVERRUSH programs and previous studies, ensuring the validity of our machine learning selection. In addition, we find that the object-matching rates between our LAE catalogs and our previous results are \$\simeq 80\$-\$100\$% at bright NB magnitudes of \$\lesssim 24\$ mag. We also confirm that the surface number densities of our LAE candidates are consistent with previous results. Our LAE catalogs will be made public on our project webpage.},
