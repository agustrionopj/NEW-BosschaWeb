abstract: "The spectral evolution of the Nova V5668 Sgr has been observed on 12 June, 23 June, and 15 August 2015 using NEO-R1000 spectrograph attached to the C-11 telescope at Bosscha Observatory, Lembang, Indonesia. The observed spectra indicate that the nova has been entering the nebular phase. The spectra during this phase showed strong forbidden lines of [O I] $\\lambda$6300, 6364, [O II] $\\lambda$7320, and [O III] $\\lambda$5007, [N II] $\\lambda$5755. The spectra also showed emission line of Fe II $\\lambda$4924, 5169, 5317, 6149. We classify Nova V5668 Sgr into the Fe II type. We present and discuss the variation of nebular abundance N(X)/N(H) of the Nova V5668 Sgr in the light of its evolutionary stages."
