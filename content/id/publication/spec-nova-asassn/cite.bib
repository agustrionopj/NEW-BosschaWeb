	abstract = {We report optical spectroscopic observations in 2017 at Bosscha Observatory on an interesting nova, ASASSN-17hx (Nova Sct 2017). The nova ASASSN-17hx was observed on July 26th, July 29th, July 31st, and August 14th. Based on the light curve, we propose that our spectroscopic observation of ASASSN-17hx was conducted during “iron curtain” phase. The observed spectra showed a strong Hα emission line and multiple emission lines of Fe II multiplets, which is typical for a Fe II type nova. However, since ASASSN-17hx was classified as a He/N type only few days after its outburst, it is suggested that the nova is actually a hybrid type nova. We will discuss the characteristic of ASASSN-17hx by analysing its expansion velocity, electron density, and evolution of the emission lines.}
