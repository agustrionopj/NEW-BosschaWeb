 abstract = {We report the serendipitous discovery of HSC J0904\$-\$0102, a quadruply-lensed
Lyman break galaxy (LBG) in the Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in
Hyper Suprime-Cam Imaging (SuGOHI). Owing to its point-like appearance, the
source was thought to be a lensed active galactic nucleus. We obtained
follow-up spectroscopic data with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs on the
Gemini South Telescope, which confirmed this to be a lens system. The
deflecting foreground galaxy is a typical early-type galaxy at a high redshift
of \$z_\\ell\ = 0.957\$ with stellar velocity dispersion \$σ_v=259\pm56\$
km~s\$\textasciicircum\-1\\$. The lensed source is identified as an LBG at \$z_\\rm s\ = 3.403\$,
based on the sharp drop bluewards of Ly\$α\$ and other absorption features.
A simple lens mass model for the system, assuming a singular isothermal
ellipsoid, yields an Einstein radius of \$θ_\\rm Ein\ = 1.
23\textasciicircum\\prime\prime\\$ and a total mass within the Einstein radius of \$M_\\rm Ein\
= (5.55\pm 0.24) \times 10\textasciicircum\11\M_\\odot\\$ corresponding to a velocity
dispersion of \$σ_\\rm SIE\= 283\pm 3\$ km~s\$\textasciicircum\-1\\$, which is in good
agreement with the value derived spectroscopically. The most isolated lensed
LBG image has a magnification of \$\sim 6.5\$. In comparison with other lensed
LBGs and typical \$z\sim4\$ LBG populations, HSC J0904\$-\$0102 is unusually
compact, an outlier at \$\textgreater2σ\$ confidence. Together with a previously
discovered SuGOHI lens, HSC J1152\$+\$0047, that is similarly compact, we believe
that the HSC Survey is extending LBG studies down to smaller galaxy sizes.},
