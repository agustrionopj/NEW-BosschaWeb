abstract: "We report the serendipitous discovery of HSC J0904$-$0102, a quadruply-lensed Lyman break galaxy (LBG) in the Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in Hyper Suprime-Cam Imaging (SuGOHI). Owing to its point-like appearance, the source was thought to be a lensed active galactic nucleus. We obtained follow-up spectroscopic data with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs on the Gemini South Telescope, which confirmed this to be a lens system. The deflecting foreground galaxy is a typical early-type galaxy at a high redshift of $z_ {\\ell} = 0.957$ with stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma_v = 259 \\pm 56$ km s$^{-1}$. The lensed source is identified as an LBG at $z_\\mathrm{s} = 3.403$, based on the sharp drop bluewards of Ly$\\alpha$ and other absorption features. A simple lens mass model for the system, assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid, yields an Einstein radius of $\\theta_ \\mathrm{Ein} = 1. 23^{\\prime\\prime}$ and a total mass within the Einstein radius of $M_ \\mathrm{Ein} = (5.55 \\pm 0.24) \\times 10^{11}\\mskip3mu M_ \\odot$ corresponding to a velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_ \\mathrm{SIE}= 283 \\pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$, which is in good agreement with the value derived spectroscopically. The most isolated lensed LBG image has a magnification of $\\sim 6.5$. In comparison with other lensed LBGs and typical $z \\sim 4$ LBG populations, HSC J0904$-$0102 is unusually compact, an outlier at $\\gt 2\\sigma$ confidence. Together with a previously discovered SuGOHI lens, HSC J1152$+$0047, that is similarly compact, we believe that the HSC Survey is extending LBG studies down to smaller galaxy sizes."
