abstract: "A synthesis method is used to analyze B and V observations of Delta Cap obtained at the Bosscha Observatory in 1984 and 1985. Both components of the binary are found to be well inside their critical Roche lobes. The data are consistent with a model using a mass radio $q = 0.365$ which yields a main-sequence mass for the primary star. A distance of 8-11 pc is implied."
