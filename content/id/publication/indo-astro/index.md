abstract: "In this paper I identify a number of research topoics relating to Indonesian astronomical history that I feel are of international importance. Through these studies, Indonesia can make a valuable contribution to international history of astronomy. I also will discuss the role of SEAAN's new Working Group on Astronomical History and Heritage, and the values of the Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage and proceedings of the ICOA conferences as outlets for papers about Indonesian astronomical history. Finally, I mention chapters about Indonesia that will appear in a forthcoming book on the early development of astrophysics in Asia."
