abstract: "Most methods of orbit determination are often difficult for numerical implementations since they are developed before the computer era. The recently developed mathematical technique of semi-definite programming (SDP) has been implemented for many problems in scientific fields including astrometry. This is a good opportunity to resolve orbits of binary systems located in the southern hemisphere since more than seventy years Bosscha Observatory had been continuously conducting observations of binary systems. Here we describe prospects of application of SDP for deriving orbital parameters of binary systems using data supplied by Bosscha Observatory that has been published in the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg. This study will support observers at Bosscha Observatory to appropriately select target stars belong to binary systems for their ongoing researches. Since SDP is a powerful scheme, free trial-and-error and human-independent judgment, we suggest that SDP may become a standard method for determining orbital parameters of binary systems."
