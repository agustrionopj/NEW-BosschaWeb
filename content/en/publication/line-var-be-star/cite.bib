	abstract = {We present the spectroscopic variations of 14 program Be stars observed within 2008 – 2009 at the Bosscha Observatory, Lembang, Indonesia, using Zeiss Double Refractor equipped with Bosscha Compact Spectrograph. The Be stars show spectroscopic profiles as Be and Beshell, and sometimes as B-normal. These profiles originate from the disk-like envelope or rings surrounded the star’s equatorial plane. Our program stars are: 5 as Be single-peaked, 2 as Be double-peak, and 7 as B-normal stars. We also measure the Ip/Ic ratio from the line profiles.}
