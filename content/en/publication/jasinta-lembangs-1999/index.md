abstract: "The photographic observations on the components of Sirius were made at the Bosscha Observatory (1955 - 1986) after the invention of the Sirius grating by van Albada (1956). This special grating enables to photograph the two components that differ by 10 magnitudes. An overview on the technique of the photographic observations on this pair is presented, as well as the method of measurements and reductions."
