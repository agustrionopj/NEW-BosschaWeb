 abstract = {All the southern globules in the catalog of Bok and Cordwell (1973) but one have been surveyed for candidates for T Tau stars using the 51/71- cm Bosscha Schmidt telescope with an objective prism. A total of six Hα- emission objects, three of which are new, and fifteen suspected ones have been found in the survey area of altogether 3.28 square degrees in and around 24 globules. However, some circumstantial evidence suggests a low possibility of their T Tau nature collectively. The celestial coordinates and rough estimates of the magnitude and color of the stars are derived from the Palomar Sky Survey prints.},
