On Sunday, Bosscha Observatory went to Sasana Budaya Ganesha with a specific mission. The team, which included 13 astronomy students from ITB, was there to communicate astronomy to the public, especially to children, at Festival Anak Bertanya 2019 (FAB, or Festival for Children with Questions) held on Sunday, July 28th, 2019.

FAB is an annual event organized by the Perkumpulan Mitra Anak Bertanya, Direktorat Olahraga, and Sabuga ITB to commemorate National Children's Day. This year, FAB collaborated with Planet Sains to organize both FAB and Festival Planet Sains.

Together with other astronomical groups and organizations such as Dunia Astronomi, LAPAN, and Langit Selatan, Bosscha Observatory participated as an interactive exhibitor at the FAB. Bosscha Observatory brought back the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing theme, which was previously presented at our Open House on July 13th.

The visitors, children participants and their parents, were welcomed by posters about the Moon and light pollution. Our team also carried posters about our public visit programme, like the regular schedule, how to register, and what to expect and to do when visiting our observatory.

Inside our stand, there were short videos about astronomy which is displayed through the projector. Besides videos and posters, there were two things that caught the attention of the participants, the first was the full Moon puzzle. The participants who successfully finished the puzzle were given souvenirs, like bookmarks.

The second was a small telescope which was located in front of the stand. This telescope was directed to one of the random objects available at Sabuga hall. The size of objects seen through a telescope was compared to the size of objects when seen with the naked eye. This comparison aimed to make participants understand that one of the functions of the telescope is to increase the size of the intended object.

When the day was getting late, and the clock showed the time at 17:00 WIB (UT+7), FAB 2019 was declared over. After that, our team took a group photo. Hopefully what the team does can ignite public curiosity, especially children about science and astronomy.
