On 13 and 14 October 2018 Bosscha Observatory organized the Elementary Training on Hilal Observation and Data Processing for the academics from the Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB). This program aimed to introduce basic aspects about hilal observation and image processing procedure. It highlighted basic concepts of telescope operation, preparation for observation, and image processing from the observational results. There were 15 participants from undergraduate and graduate students of the Astronomy Department of ITB.

After a brief opening in Wisma Kerkhoven, the workshop was started with the introduction on practical astronomy by Agus Triono PJ. This lecture essentially explained how telescopes work, so participants can understand how to operate it properly. After break, the day then continued with hilal and telescope session, delivered by Muhammad Yusuf. Yusuf explained tips and tricks to calibrate and align the telescope to optimize its operation. 

Later in the night session, all participants were invited to align the telescope's polar axis by themselves and let them familiarize with it. Unfortunately due to bad weather, this session ended early at 23:45 WIB (UT+7). Nevertheless, some participants continued the polar alignment at 03:00 WIB the next day with better sky condition.

The next morning after breakfast, participants continued their telescope alignment practice and tried to point it to bright objects like Sun, Mercury, Venus, and other bright stars. But unfortunately, the heavy clouds covered nearly the whole sky. The session finally ended at 10:30 WIB and then continued with the data processing workshop inside Wisma Kerkhoven.

Participants processed the hilal observation results originated from our team and tried to present their best outcome of hilal portrait. The session closed after small discussion with all participants about their impression, vision, and hope in the future about their new knowledge and experience gained during the workshop. Dr. Premana W. Premadi, the Director of Bosscha Observatory, also attended and greeted all the participants. 

Itâ€™s within our expectation that many knowledge and experiences during the workshop can be disseminated widely, so more people can perform astronomy observation especially hilal observation with the right procedure so they can make reliable and scientific results from it.

Until the next workshop. Clear skies!
