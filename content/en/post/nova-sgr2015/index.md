Novae is a phenomenon of star explosions, which is interesting to study by doing spectroscopy observations on them. According to many studies, novae is the result of close binary star interaction whose orbit period is less than 16 hours, with white dwarf as primary star and main sequence star usually as secondary star (they commonly have G, K, or M spectrum class).  When a close secondary star enlarges beyond the Roche system boundary due to stellar evolution process, the star can be partially attracted to the primary star; mass transfer occurs due to tidal forces. Material that moves to the primary star can then form an accretion disk around the primary star. This material accumulates gradually, then forms a new layer on the surface of a white dwarf star. Due to the very strong gravity of the white draft, this new layer is in a semi-degenerated state. As the mass increased, the temperature of this new layer continues to rise until it reaches critical temperature, which triggers an uncontrolled thermonuclear process (*Thermonuclear Runaway*) (José, 2012).

Sgr 2015 No.2 (V5668 Sgr) Novae, first discovered by John Seach (Chatsworth Island, NSW, Australia) in March 2015, is located at  $ \alpha(2000.0) = 18^\mathrm{h} 36^\mathrm{m} 56.84^\mathrm{s}$  and $\delta (2000.0) = -28^\circ 55' 39.8''$. The Novae was also successfully observed on June 12nd, June 23rd, and August 15th of 2015 by using the NEO-R1000 spectrograph mounted on the C-11 Celestron telescope at Bosscha Observatory. This figure is an illustration of the location of the ‘star explosion’ phenomenon coordinate.

Observations from our observatory resulted in three nova spectra which showed a change in the shape of the spectrum.

The gradual changing in the spectrum and shifts in the emission line peaks can indicate physical changes and dynamics of the solar envelope (an outer star gas layer that envelops the leftovers from the exploded star). After reaching its luminosity peak, the absorption lines in the novae will begin to show emission lines. The blackbody continuum then becomes weak and the emissions lines strengthen, indicating an expanding area of hot gas. The transition from novae spectrum to nebular spectrum by widening emission line is due to the very high rate of development and the formation of an accretion disk. Some of the forbidden emission lines that often form in the nebular spectrum are N II, O III, and Ne III.

Based on the William’s (1992) scheme, Sgr 2015 No. 2 Novae is a type of Fe II novae. Novae spectrum analysis is closely related to changes in the light curve of novae itself. Therefore, the observation time is important to know the position of Sgr 2015 No.2 Novae in each stage of the process.

The observations on June 12nd, 2015 showed its brightness at around magnitude 8-9, while on June 23rd it was around 11-12 mag. On both dates, Sgr 2015 No. 2 Novae is in the nebulae and dust formation stage. Drastic decreases in the light curve observed on both occasions indicate a reduction in intensity due to the formation of new envelopes. In this stage, there was a significant expansion of the envelopes. The analysis of P-Cygni profile lines in Hβ = 4861 Angstrom obtained its expansion rate at 2087 ± 179 km/s. With this speed, the material in the envelopes ejected far out radially. The envelopes then became increasingly thin so its intensity was rebounded as indicated by the arrow at the observation result on August 15th.

This observation and analysis on novae was carried out by Robiatul Muztaba, an UGM physics alumni who then continued his graduate program at the ITB astronomy postgraduate study program. The results presented here are part of his thesis work.
