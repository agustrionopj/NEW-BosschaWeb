In 1947, Egbert A. Kreiken, the former staff of Bosscha Observatory who was the Head of Indonesian Higher Education Directorate at that time attended the UNESCO General Meeting in Mexico. In this meeting, Bosscha Observatory got a donation for making an optic telescope from UNESCO. This news then reached the Bosscha Observatory in 1948 (van Dien, 1995) and was officially delivered to the Indonesian government in 1950. The Indonesian government approved this donation in December of the same year (The, 1961; Van Albada, 1951).

Initially, the planned telescope was a 36-inch (f/14) Cassegrain for photometric observation purposes (The, 1961; Van Albada, 1953). This photometric optical telescope should be made at the Yerkes Observatory. However, based on observations of G. Bruno van Albada, director of the Bosscha Observatory at that time, the transparency of the sky at the observatory varied throughout the year so it was not suitable for photometry. This was later conveyed by Van Albada to the director of the Yerkes Observatory, Gerard P. Kuiper[^1]. Speaking of which, before the outbreak of the Second World War, Kuiper was once asked to be the Director of Bosscha Observatory. Kuiper had accepted this offer. But when the offer to become director of the Yerkes Observatory came, Kuiper changed his mind and chose to remain in America (van Dien, 1995; Osterbrock, 1997).

After receiving a letter from Van Albada, Kuiper offered to replace the optic telescope into a 50-cm (f/2.49) Schmidt type which was available at the Yerkes Observatory technical workshop along with an objective prism. The price of this new telescope is more expensive than the previously planned telescope. So UNESCO approved this change on condition that the Indonesian government would finance the construction of mounting, building and operating the telescope.

The funds prepared by the Indonesian government at that time were USD 16,000 while the cost of making the mount ranged from USD 150,000 - 200,000. Van Albada then contacted Jan H. Oort[^2], director of the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands to ask for a solution. Oort contacted Rademakers, a high-precision tool manufacturing company in Rotterdam who was a partner of the Leiden Observatory. It so happened that the Rademakers also became partners with the Mt. Palomar Observatory, which had just completed construction of 'the big S', the largest Schmidt telescope in the world at that time. Oort also contacted the director of the Mt. Palomar Observatory which later allowed the use of the 'the big S' telescope blueprint design for free use at Bosscha Observatory.
In 1954, the Indonesian government was supposed to sign a contract to make telescope mounting with Rademakers. However, it was delayed until June 1956 because two Indonesian officials who were supposed to sign the contract were at odds and did not talk to each other, so the contract was signed separately. Mounting construction finally began in 1957 and completed in March 1958 at a cost of only USD 17,000. Additional funding of USD 1,000 comes from the Leiden Observatory.

In May 1958, the telescope’s mount arrived at the Port of Tanjung Priok, Jakarta. On the final journey to the observatory, many problems arose such as running out of gas, a lifting crane for the mount were damaged, and an oversized mounting container that could not enter the supposed building. But as always, solutions are always found (van Dien, 1995). The Bima Sakti telescope building is located on the east side of the Bosscha Observatory, at latitude coordinates $−6^\circ 49' 32.0^{\prime\prime}$ and longitude $107^\circ 36' 57.6^{\prime\prime}$ (Lukac dan Miller, 2000) which was once occupied by the Bamberg astrophotography telescope which was damaged during the second world war (The, 1961).

This telescope was named by van Albada as the Bima Sakti, because the main use of this telescope is to examine the Milky Way galaxy. Furthermore, if initials are used (the use of common initials is carried out in scientific journal publications or writing in star catalogs) BS can mean the Bima Sakti, Bosscha Sterrenwacht, or Bernhard Schmidt. Even though the mount was installed, the optical part of the telescope only arrived at Bosscha Observatory a year later. The cause was a boycott carried out by the Indonesian government against the Dutch people, which made Van Albada uncomfortable and decided not to renew his contract with the Indonesian government. Van Albada returned to the Netherlands in July 1958. This made Gerard Kuiper reluctant to hand over the telescope optics in view of the absence of the astronomer responsible at the Bosscha Observatory. Luckily at that time Van Albada's first student, Pik-Sin The, had completed his doctoral studies in America. Pik-Sin The was then appointed Director of the Bosscha Observatory in 1959 and optical telescopes arrived at the observatory in December 1959. When transporting from the Port of Tanjung Priok to Lembang, the truck ran slowly so that the mirror did not shake. Truck gear never passed through second gear with a maximum speed of 30 km/hour. The Jakarta-Lembang trip took seven hours (Haryadi, 2013).

Installation of mirrors and corrector lenses was done in less than two months by Pik-Sin The and Victor Blanco who had the experience with the Burrell Schmidt telescope (Blanco, 2001). In May 1960, the telescope optics were well installed and an observation test (first light) was carried out with objects in the sky area around Eta-Carinae (The, 1961). The handover was carried out from the UNESCO representative for Indonesia, Dr. Mattson, to the Indonesian government in the same month.

The presence of the Bima Sakti telescope brings great hope to be able to further explore the Milky Way galaxy, given the geographical conditions of the Bosscha Observatory. This hope is contained in the Bosscha Observatory booklet (van Albada, 1955) and several articles in the mass media (Larson, 1971; Haryadi, 2013).
