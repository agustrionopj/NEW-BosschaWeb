Up until recently, illustrations of a black hole were based on theoretical studies. But this
will change along with the release of the first observational image of a black hole, which in
this case is the supermassive black hole that resides in the heart of our Milky Way galaxy.
A large telescope array collaboration project named The Event Horizon Telescope that
consists of 8 radio telescopes that spread out to cover both of Earth’s hemispheres,
enabling astronomers to capture very high-resolution images of our galaxy’s center which
allow them to photograph the black hole directly. 

The press release of this first black hole photo is set to be held on April 10th of 2019, at 20:00 WIB (UT+7).
