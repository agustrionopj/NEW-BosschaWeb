On Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019, Bosscha Observatory was honored to be visited by Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi from the United States. Dr. Oluseyi is a leading research professor in the fields of aerospace, physics, and space science at George Mason University. Prior to his current position, he taught at the Florida Institute of Technology and was assigned to NASA as the Manager of Space Science Education for their Science Missions. He is also a productive communicator in the field of advanced science through television shows and a TedX speaker.

Astronomers from Bosscha Observatory had the opportunity to talk with him about many things, especially the condition of science education in Indonesia and trending science topics within the general public. Dr. Oluseyi shared many personal experiences in conveying science to the public and gave lots of advice on how to communicate science in a fun and effective way, some of it through rap music and dance, as he did. Are you interested in how Dr. Oluseyi delivered science? You can watch him in many documentary programmes like "How the Universe Works", which produced by Discovery Channel.
