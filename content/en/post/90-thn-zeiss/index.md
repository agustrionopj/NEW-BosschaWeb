On June 7th, 1928, K.A.R. Bosscha as the head of Nederlandsch Indische Sterrenkundige Vereeniging (NISV) officially inaugurated the biggest and most modern astronomy observation facility in Asia at that time, which was a double refractor telescope made by Zeiss to be used for the scientific advancement, especially in the field of astronomy, and to elevate the role of scientist in the Indonesian archipelago. The handover was witnessed by A.C.D. de Graeff as the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies. Followed by that, the first Director of Bosscha Observatory, Dr. J.G.E.G. Voute ran the observation and research program that would establish the observatory’s contribution to the scientific community worldwide. Observation of double stars was one of the programs that was prioritized, considering the rapid development of stellar physics at that time.

In the next decades, Bosscha Observatory had a series of management changes. Since 1951, Bosscha Observatory has become a part of Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) and carried out the national higher educational principles (Tri Dharma Perguruan Tinggi). With various supports, Bosscha Observatory continues to contribute the results of many observations and astronomical researches for the development of astronomy, organize tertiary astronomy education in Indonesia, constructively interact with international communities, and provide educational service to the public.

For Bosscha Observatory to keep functioning optimally to gather high-quality astronomical data, clean and minimally light-polluted skies as an effect of poorly arranged lights are in need. Along with the growth of urban areas around Lembang, like those experienced by other observatories around the world, light and air pollution have become one of the biggest challenges for Bosscha
Observatory. 

To ensure the continuation of Bosscha Observatory’s role for science development in Indonesia and the world, ITB invites collaborative efforts with the Provincial Government of West Java, related institution, and general public to ensure protections for the observatory from negative impacts of urban growth and to proactively reduce light pollution in the Bandung area through laws of lighting systems that will be prepared and enforced. It is expected that there will be laws that will further embody the Indonesian Presidential Regulation No. 45 of 2018 concerning the Bandung Basin Urban Spatial Plan, which explicitly mentions the need to protect Bosscha Observatory as a resource of scientific, cultural, and historic facilities. Protection in the form of laws is also needed as a form of appreciation from the public, government, and institution regarding Bosscha Observatory’s position as a national cultural heritage that is certified by the Minister of Education and Cultural on September 24th, 2018. 

Good sky quality, which is free from air and light pollution, is needed more for the quality of human life, biodiversity, and ecosystem balance, which are a very important part of sustainable development, especially in Indonesia.
