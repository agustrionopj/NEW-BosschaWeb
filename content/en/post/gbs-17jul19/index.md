### Lunar Eclipse
The Moon is the only natural satellite that revolves around the Earth. The Moon and Earth together revolve around the Sun as the center of the Solar System. On some occasions, the Earth’s position aligns between the Moon and the Sun. As a result, the sunlight that reaches the Moon is blocked by the Earth. In other words, the Moon enters Earth's shadow. This phenomenon is called the Lunar eclipse. The opposite of it, when the Moon blocks the sunlight that should reach the Earth, is called the Solar eclipse.
Based on the section of Earth's shadow that was passed by the Moon, there are three types of Lunar eclipse: Total Lunar Eclipse, Partial Lunar Eclipse, and Penumbral Lunar Eclipse. When a Total Lunar Eclipse occurs, the Moon enters Earth's umbra (the main shadow of Earth). But when only some part of the Moon disk enters the Earth’s umbra and the other parts are in Earth's penumbra (the faint shadow of Earth), a Partial Lunar Eclipse occurs. A Penumbral Lunar Eclipse occurs when the entire Moon disk passes across the Earth's penumbra.

Based on the astronomical calculation, there will be 5 eclipses occurring in 2019. These are Total Solar Eclipse on January 5th to 6th, Total Lunar Eclipse on January 21st, Total Solar Eclipse on July 2nd, Partial Lunar Eclipse on July 17th, and Annular Solar Eclipse on December 26th. Of those 5 eclipses, only 2 can be observed in Indonesia, Partial Lunar Eclipse on July 17th and Annular Solar Eclipse on December 26th.

### Partial Lunar Eclipse on 17 July 2019 

Partial Lunar Eclipse on 17 July 2019 can be seen almost in all regions of the Earth, namely in South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. In Indonesia, it can be observed when the Moon is going to set.

This lunar eclipse will last for 5 hours, 33 minutes, and 43 seconds. For the western part of Indonesia, the eclipse starts at 01:42:06 WIB (UT+7) and ends at 07:19:30 WIB, when the eclipse cannot be observed anymore since the Moon has already set. During the Partial Lunar Eclipse, for 2 hours 57 minutes 56 seconds, about 60% of the Moon surfaces will be inside the Earth's shadow. The time of the occurrence of the Partial Lunar Eclipse in Indonesia is listed below.

### Bosscha Observatory did not Hold Public Observation of This Partial Lunar Eclipse

On July 17th of 2019, Bosscha Observatory did not open public visits for the Partial Lunar Eclipse observation. The Partial Lunar Eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that can be seen directly without any aid of special optical instrumentation as long as the sky is clear without clouds. Therefore, Bosscha Observatory encourages the public to observe it together from their respective places. We wish you happy observing, we hope the sky is clear!
