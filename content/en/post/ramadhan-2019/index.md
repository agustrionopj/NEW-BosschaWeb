As an astronomical education and research institution, Bosscha Observatory held monthly hilal (young crescent Moon) observations. The observation that was done on May 5th, 2019, marked the transition from Shaban to Ramadan 1440H in the Hijri (Islamic) calendar system.

### Observations Were Done in Lembang and Kupang

The team from Bosscha Observatory conducted hilal observation at Bosscha Observatory in Lembang and at Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara on May 5, 2019. The observation in each site started in the morning until the Moon set on the western horizon. The observation of the young crescent Moon by Bosscha Observatory was aimed at examining the  visibility threshold as a function of elongation and thickness of the crescent, and also in the context of rukyatul hilal for Ramadan 1440H. Rukyatul hilal was done in the afternoon and the detection of the crescent was done after sunset. The young crescent that was visible after sunset was called
hilal.

Bosscha Observatory had become one of the sites to conduct rukyatul hilal of Ramadan and Shawwal by the regional office of The Ministry of Religious Affairs with some Islamic organizations for every year. The observation in Kupang was a continuation of the collaboration between Bosscha Observatory and the Hisab Rukyat and Sharia Subdivision of the Directorate for Islamic Affairs and Sharia Guidances of The Directorate General for Islamic Community Counsel of The Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and supported by the team of Nusa Cendana University (UNDANA) and astronomy education enthusiasts in Kupang, with instruments provided by the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN). The observation was done at the rooftop of the PPG UNDANA dormitory.

Observations in Bosscha Observatory and Kupang used refractor telescopes with a size of 106 mm and CCD-based camera detectors, which then followed with image processing. Bosscha Observatory also provided a telescope set with an ocular lens to be used by the public who wanted to see.

### The Determination of The Start of Ramadan and Shawwal
In Indonesia, the authority to determine the beginning of Ramadan and Shawwal is carried by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, through the process of itsbat assembly. The mission of the Bosscha Observatory is to present the results of calculations, observations, and research on the hilal to the relevant government units if needed as inputs for the itsbat assembly. General public can access the hilal data and observations on the Bosscha Observatory website, https://bosscha.itb.ac.id.
