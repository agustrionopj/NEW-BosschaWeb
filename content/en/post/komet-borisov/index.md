After Oumuamua, a space rock from outside of the Solar system, ‘visited’ our Solar system in October 2017, astronomers think they might have found another foreign rock wandering the interstellar space and approaching our Solar system. But this time, it may take a longer time than before, which offers a special opportunity that has never happened before.

An object found by Ukraine amateur astronomer, Gennady Borisov, on 30 August 2019 was confirmed by NASA Minor Planet Center as a comet named C/2019 Q4 or Borisov Comet. Borisov works at MARGO Observatory in Nauchny-Crimea. Using a telescope that was assembled by himself half a year ago, Borisov did an observation on the area of the sky that is avoided by many astronomers because of its direction heading to the bright area near the horizon, that makes the observation more complicated and could damage the telescope optic sensitivity. This observation was done in the northeast direction near the horizon, around the Gemini constellation.

This discovery was welcomed by professional astronomers and further observation was done, one of them used 10.4-meters telescope Gran Telescopio Canaris (GTC) at La Palma. This observation successfully yields high-resolution images and the visible spectrum of C/2019 Q4 (Borisov) comet. The results of the 13 September 2019 observation strengthen the conjecture that Borisov comet is a comet that has a well-defined coma and tail. Coma is a unique characteristic of a comet, which is composed of layers of dust and gases that envelop the core. Spectroscopy observation could reveal the chemical characteristics of the coma, such as the molecular compositions and element abundances like carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, "This object spectrum is similar to Solar system comets, and it shows that their compositions must be alike", said Julia de Leon, a member of the observer team at GTC. This fact alone was something that was not expected before.

An observation by Karen Meech and the team from Hawaii University estimated the diameter of the core is around 2-16 km. C/2019 Q4 comet was observed to have high-velocity, which indicates that it comes from outside of the Solar system. With the velocity of 150,000 km per hour, the C/2019 Q4 comet has a parabolic orbit. Rather than orbiting the Sun, this comet will only have close fly-by toward the Sun and return back to interstellar space. Astronomers use eccentricity (e) parameter to determine the orbit curvature of the object. If e = 0, the orbit would be a perfect circle. If e = 1, it would be very ellipse. If e > 1, it would be hyperbolic. Based on NASA JPL's Small-Body Database, C/2019 Q4 comet eccentricity is larger than 3.5.

Right now, the C/2019 Q4 comet is entering the Solar system, so there will be more time available for further observation. This comet is 420 million kilometers from the Sun and will reach its perihelion around 300 million kilometers distance from the Sun (around 2 times of Sun-Earth distance) on 8 December 2019. On 26 October 2019, this comet will pass through the ecliptic plane (Earth and other planets' orbit plane) with the inclination of 40 degrees.

This time, the C/2019 Q4 comet can not be observed clearly until mid-October because of its relatively-close position with the Sun. Observation can be done when the comet's brightness reaches its maximum in mid-December. When it occurs, the comet could be observed using a middle-sized telescope. This observation can only be done until April 2020. Then until October 2020, this comet could only be observed using professional telescopes.

Comets are made of ice and dust, formed in the outermost regions of a protoplanetary disc, where water is frozen because it is so far away from the central star. They are composed of debris that was left after the formation of the giant planets. Comets are the ancient relic that records the initial condition of a planetary system when planets started forming around the new-born star. Astronomers hope that further study of this comet would reveal mysteries related to the history of the formation of the planetary system, which is a very precious opportunity.
