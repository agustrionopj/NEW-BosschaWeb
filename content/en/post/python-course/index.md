Astronomy is currently growing with new facilities scattered throughout the world. The product of these facilities is data, which became widely available and increased both in quantity and size. This makes astronomy as one of the basic sciences that has a commitment to merge various disciplines to deal with them, which one of them is computing. The programming language has become something that must exist, used, and introduced early into the astronomy community.

Bosscha Observatory, as one of the astronomical research institutions in Indonesia, starts a small step by conducting a crash course in Python for research staff, lecturers, and students. This training aims as an introduction to Python and its applications in astronomical data processing. The characteristics of Python as an easy-to-use, powerful, and versatile language make Python a good choice for teaching programming languages. In addition, major Astronomy projects such as TESS, Kepler, LSST, and TMT made Python the most widely used language. This short training was carried out for 4 days (19, 20, 26, and 27 January 2019), attended by students, ITB astronomy lecturers, the observatory staff, and even from outside of astronomy community. During the training, Dr. Premana W. Premadi as the Director of Bosscha Observatory also attended and met directly with the participants.

Participants were introduced to the basics of Python, Numpy, data management with Pandas, visualization with Matplotlib, and solving cases in astronomy specifically with Astropy. Interaction between participants and each participant with the instructor was neatly woven, so some productive discussions came alive.

The training program then closed with small talk and discussion, including follow-up plans after the training, followed by a group photo. We hope this training can be useful for participants, especially in their role of analyzing astronomy data. Hope to see you at the next training, and we wish you happy coding!
