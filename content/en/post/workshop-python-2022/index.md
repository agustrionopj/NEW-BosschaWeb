Astronomy is currently developing with new facilities spread all over the world. The product of these facilities is data that is widely available and increasing both in number and size. This makes astronomy one of the basic sciences that is committed to combining various disciplines to handle it, one of which is computing. Programming languages ​​have become something that must exist, be used, and be introduced early into the astronomy community.

Bosscha Observatory, as one of the astronomical research institutes in Indonesia, started a small step by holding a Python crash course. This training aims as an introduction to Python and its application in processing astronomical data. Python's characteristics as an easy-to-use, powerful, and versatile language make Python a good choice for teaching programming languages. In addition, major Astronomy projects such as TESS, Kepler, LSST, and TMT make Python the most widely used language.

### Programme
Participants are introduced to the basics of Python, Numpy, data management with Pandas, visualization with Matplotlib, and solving astronomical cases, especially with Astropy. The course material will be delivered by Bosscha Observatory researcher Muhammad Yusuf and ITB Astronomy Study Program lecturer, Anton Timur Jaelani.

### Date and Time of Programme

- Date: 11-14 Januari 2022
- Time: 08:30 -15:00 WIB (UT+7) 

The activity will be carried out online through a zoom meeting. Participants who will take part are expected to be fully present during the workshop.

### Participants

This programme  is intended for students of the ITB Astronomy Study Program and research staff of the Bosscha Observatory with a limited quota of 20 participants.

### Registration

Registration process will be started on Wednesday, January 5th 2022 at 13:00 WIB (Ut+7)
