Bosscha Observatory, as an institution in which adhere three national higher educational principle (Tri Dharma Perguruan Tinggi), will hold an activity entitled **"Sarasehan Pengamatan Hilal Rajab 1440H dan Sosialisasi 'Dark Sky Preservation'" (Workshop on Hilal Rajab 1440H Observation and Dark Sky Preservation Socialization)** on <font color='red'>Thursday, March 7th of 2019, 14:00 - 18:30 WIB (UT+7)</font> at Bosscha Observatory.

This activity will be held in form of general presentation and hilal (young crescent Moon) observation workshop, targeted for media crew and related institution such as media partners of ITB, community service office of FMIPA ITB and LPPM ITB, LAPAN, Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Imah Noong, SESKOAU, KOWAD, SESPIMPOL, and Lembang regional leaders, including Gudangkahuripan and Lembang district head.

This public dissemination activity aims to build public understanding of hilal and hilal detection, especially in relation to the potential difference that could occur in religious holidays determination. This could be achieved by providing media crews with sufficient understanding so that they can compose a good narration to its audiences about hilal, especially in determining the upcoming start of Ramadan and Shawwal 1440H. This activity is also intended to socialize the "Dark Sky Preservation" campaign, a movement that seek to preserve the dark sky.

With this activity, we hope that there will be an increasing amount of media crews with better preparation in delivering the information about hilal in particular, and astronomy in general.
