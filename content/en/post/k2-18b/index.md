Most of us have certainly been filled with curiosity about life other than on Earth. Are there any other lives on distant planets? How can we find them? 

Until today, astronomers have found around 4,000 planets that orbit other stars. They’re called extrasolar planets or exoplanets for short. In general, a lot of those planets aren’t suitable to support life as they have exotic atmospheres and extreme temperatures. Will
there be any life on them? Astronomers are starting to answer that question by detecting the presence of the most fundamental element that supports life like all we know, water. For the first time, scientists announced the discovery of the first exoplanet with water vapor in its atmosphere. The discovery was published in two separate journals by Björn Benneke and the team from University of Montreal and by Angelo Tsiaras and the team from University College London. This discovery is so important because for the first time ever water vapor molecules are found in the atmosphere of an exoplanet far from Earth.

That planet is known as Planet K2-18b. Planet K2-18b orbits a red dwarf star that lies in the Leo constellation, with distance approximately 110 light years from Earth. Red dwarf stars are stars smaller than the Sun. The star K2-18 or EPIC 201912552 itself is only 0.35 times the mass of the Sun with temperature reaching to only 3,183 $^\circ$C. There are 2 massive
planets orbiting this star, namely K2-18b and K2-18c.

Planet K2-18b was discovered in the year 2015 by the Kepler Space Telescope, which specifically used to find exoplanets. Planet K2-18b is not like any planets in our Solar System, it is larger and heavier than Earth but smaller than Neptune, its mass is approximately 8 to 9 times the mass of the Earth and its radius is around 2.5 times the radius of Earth.

### Rain on Planet K2-18b
In 2016 and 2017, a team led by Benneke used the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate planet K2-18b’s atmosphere when it passed in front of its host star. According to the spectrum analysis, it was concluded that planet K2-18b’s atmosphere contains water vapor molecules and may support the presence of liquid water as the main requirement of supporting life. Besides water vapor, planet K2-18b is also known to
contain hydrogen and helium. Other molecules like nitrogen and methane are also thought to exist but are still undetectable.

Observations using the combination of Hubble, Spitzer, and Kepler gave clues that clouds might form on certain altitudes in the planet’s atmosphere. Moreover, the team said there could be the right pressure and atmosphere on that altitude to allow liquid water to exist.
Hereafter, this would allow water droplets to condense and fall as rain, and furthermore, the rain would condense and simultaneously create a hydrological cycle. The potential of rain water to exist made this discovery attract the attention of scientists.

### So, Is It Habitable?
More than three-quarters of the planets found by the Kepler Space Telescope are classified into two big classes: Super-Earths and Mini-Neptunes. Super-Earths are planets measuring up to 2 times the mass of the Earth and they have a solid surface. Meanwhile, Mini-Neptunes are planets with sizes of 2 to 4 times the size of the Earth and their rock
cores are covered with thick gases consisting of hydrogen and helium.

There was a debate between scientists while classifying planet K2-18b. But the majority of them agreed that rather as a Super-Earth, planet K2-18b was more appropriate to be classified as a Mini-Neptune. Although it is known to reside in the Habitable Zone that allows a planet to support the existence of liquid water, it is not known whether the planet
has a solid surface or not. Because most astronomers classify this planet as a Mini-Neptune, this reduces the possibility of life existence significantly. 

Actually, water vapor is commonly found in the universe. But finding water in its liquid form needs the right pressure and temperature. This is what makes our Earth so special. But then, although the presence of water vapor and even rain is a magnificent thing, life as we know needs a solid surface like Earth’s to flourish. Besides, planet K2-18b is known to only have an average distance of 0.15 AU from its host star. This planet has a revolution period of 33 Earth days and receives 1.28 times more light than Earth. Its equilibrium temperature
is -2 $^\circ$C and it ranges from -73 $^\circ$C to 47 $^\circ$C. Even though it is classified as warm, planet K2-18b might not be too friendly for life as a result of being exposed to high radiation from its highly active host star. Moreover, this planet is tidally locked in its star’s gravity, making one side of the planet to face the star forever and experiencing eternal dusk.

So, for life to flourish like Earth’s, planet K2-18b seems to not fulfill the criteria. But maybe this planet hosts another unknown life form in its atmosphere. Who knows. 

In the future, NASA’s TESS (Transiting Extrasolar Survey Satellite) mission hopes to detect hundreds of other Super-Earths or Mini-Neptunes. The next generation of space telescopes, like James Webb Space Telescope, will be able to identify atmospheric characteristics of exoplanets in great detail, even their biosignatures that will provide signs of life. Let’s just wait for other surprises!
