As we closely follow the news about the eruption of Mount Tangkuban Parahu, we are expecting all
potential visitors of Bosscha Observatory <font color='red'>to read and check all news that circulated on social media
and fact-check it with the official announcements from the Center of Volcanology and Geological
Disaster Mitigation (Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi, PVMBG)</font> on the following <a href="http://www.vsi.esdm.go.id/index.php/gunungapi/aktivitas-gunungapi" target=_blank>link</a>.

Thank you.
