On September 8, 2019, our astronomers Agus Triono P. J. and Irfan Imaduddin had the opportunity to capture the rare phenomenon of the Saturn eclipsed by the Moon (also known as the Lunar Occultation). The weather was thick and cloudy that night, making it difficult for observers to record this event.

Sometimes, Saturn and Moon popped up behind the clouds, and this opportunity was not wasted by our observers. Equipped with a 10-inch Meade telescope combined with a ZWO ASI 120MM which was installed as a slit viewer for LHIRES III spectrograph, this event was successfully recorded. When it was observed from the Bosscha Observatory, the disappearance of Saturn behind the Moon occurred at 21:24 WIB (UT+7) and reappeared at 21:53 WIB.
Please enjoy the following observation result by the astronomers from Bosscha Observatory.
