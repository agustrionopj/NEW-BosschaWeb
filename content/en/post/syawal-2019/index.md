As an astronomical education and research institution, Bosscha Observatory held monthly hilal (young crescent Moon) observations. In early June 2019, we will enter the transition from Ramadan to Shawwal 1440H in the Hijri (Islamic) calendar system.

### Bosscha Observatory doesn’t carry out hilal observation for Shawwal 1440H 

The transition of the month in the Hijri calendar will be marked by ijtima or conjunction. In this case, conjunction is an event when the Sun and Moon are on one ecliptic line.

On Monday, June 3rd of 2019 (29 Ramadan 1440H), the Sun-Moon conjunction occurred at 17:01:56 WIB and the Sunset at 17:40:01 WIB. The young crescent formed after the sunset has an altitude difference from the Sun by $0^\circ 6' 13.9^{\prime\prime}$, elongation of $2^\circ 48' 24.7^{\prime\prime}$ and the age of the Moon is 38 minutes 4 seconds. This resulted in the Moon setting almost simultaneously with the setting of the Sun.

Based on these parameters, it is certain that the hilal will be very difficult to observe from Bosscha Observatory, so we decided not to observe the hilal ahead of Shawwal 1440 H. 

### The Determination of Ramadan and Shawwal

In Indonesia, the authority to determine the beginning of Ramadan and Shawwal is carried by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, through the process of itsbat assembly.

The mission of the Bosscha Observatory is to present the results of calculations, observations, and research on the hilal to the relevant government units if needed as inputs for the itsbat assembly. General public can access the hilal data and observations on the Bosscha Observatory website https://bosscha.itb.ac.id.
