As an astronomical education and research institution, Bosscha Observatory held monthly hilal (young crescent Moon) observations. On August 31st 2019, we conducted the hilal observation as we entered the transition from Dzulhijjah to Muharram 1440H in the Hijri Islamic) calendar system.

### Observation was conducted in Kupang

Our team conducted hilal observation in Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara on August 31st 2019. This observation was started in the morning until moonset on the west horizon.

The objective of this observation is to research the visibility threshold of the Moon as a function of elongation and thickness of the crescent. Observed from Kupang on August 30th, 2019, coinciding with Dzulhijjah 29th, 1440H, the Moonâ€™s conjunction appeared after both the Sun and the Moon set, therefore the Rukyatul Hilal observation could not be conducted. While for the observation from our observatory in Lembang, we only had a 30 seconds observation window to observe the hilal crescent with the age of the Moon is only 12 minutes, which means that the Hilal cannot be observed. 

The observation in Kupang is supported by Nusa Cendana University (UNDANA) and astronomy education enthusiasts in Kupang with instrument support from the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN). The observation was done at the rooftop of the PPG UNDANA dormitory. The observation used 106mm telescope refractor type and CCD-based camera detector, which later followed by image processing. 

### Announcement of the beginning of Muharram 1441H

In Indonesia, the authority to determine the beginning of the Hijri calendar is carried by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, through the process of itsbat assembly.

The mission of the Bosscha Observatory is to present the results of calculations, observations, and research on the hilal to the relevant government units if needed as inputs for the itsbat assembly. General public can access the hilal data and observations on the Bosscha Observatory website, https://bosscha.itb.ac.id.
