About a week ago on Thursday, March 7th, Bosscha Observatory conducted the Workshop on Hilal (young crescent Moon) Observation on Rajab 1440H and Dark Sky Preservation Socialization. This event was held in Wisma Kerkhoven at Bosscha Observatory and attended by more than 40 participants from various fields. The aim of this workshop was to develop public understanding regarding hilal detection.

Participants first paid attention to the dark sky preservation presentation that was delivered by the Director of Bosscha Observatory, Dr. Premana W. Premadi. One key point of this speech is that dark sky preservation is not only important for astronomy observation but also for better quality of life.

The discussion then continued with the philosophy around hilal and the importance of qualified hilal observation by Dr. Moedji Raharto of Astronomy ITB. In his session, he mentioned one of the purposes from these activities is to establish an islamic calendar system which can be referred for religious and other needs in the future. 

Last session was presented by Muhammad Yusuf, B.Sc., entitled the Technical Aspect and Challenge in Hilal Observation. In his exposition, Yusuf said that hilal observation is not always easy. Several factors may occur that make hilal observation complicated, like low contrast and atmospheric refraction. He added that in order to deal with these kinds of extreme conditions, we need extreme solutions too. Better preparations in determining the location, time, and suitable instrument(s) is a crucial thing to do. The instruments have to be set correctly to ensure the telescope points to the right position.

Yusuf also mentioned the benefit of image processing technology, which is to maintain the objectivity and credibility of hilal observation results. Moreover, Yusuf personally suggested to reconsider the current criteria on hilal height and age, because sometimes hilal still can be observed at the event of conjunction or at 0 degree after sunset.

In the afternoon session, our astronomers demonstrated in front of participants the step-by-step procedure on portable telescopes assembly. Due to the cloudy weather, the hilal observation session was cancelled and replaced by small groups discussion on technical aspects of hilal observation. The participants were seen enthusiastic with questions  on various things about hilal, instruments, and other technical aspects about the observation.

Ojan, one of participants that represents the Educational and Cultural Service of West Java Provincial Government commented that this event was beneficial to educate the public about hilal observation. He felt jubilant to participate in this workshop since it was his first experience. “It was so exciting, I finally knew how hilal observation works. It was not as easy as I imagined”, Ojan said.
