## Library
***
{{<foldergallery src="library" >}}

The early collection of the Bosscha Observatory Library was obtained from Prof. Sande Bakhuijzen, former director of the Leiden Observatory in the 1920s, including <font color='red'>Vierteljahrsschrift der Astronomischen Geselschaft</font> published in 1867; also <font color='red'>Koninklijjke Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam</font> (1906-1917). In order to add books collection for astronomers' research needs, the first director of Bosscha Observatory Dr. Voute donated his personal book collection. This collection of old publications can be said to be an antique collection in the Bosscha Observatory Library. The oldest book published is <font color='red'>Astronomica Danica</font>, published in 1640. Another historic collection is <font color='red'>Annalen from Bosscha Observatory</font> which contains research on the 1926 double star and documentation of the construction of the Bosscha Observatory.

In addition to getting assistance from various agencies and individuals both from within and outside the country, LKBF (Leids Kerkhoven Bosscha Fond) has allocated books and journal subscriptions to Bosscha Observatory since 1954. Therefore, the Bosscha Observatory Library has the most complete collection of publications and astronomical journals in South East Asia.

New publications which are received from various countries as exchanges or gifts between institutions are displayed in the Reading Room. This Reading Room is open 24 hours, usually used by students who carry out their final project and observation. Bosscha Observatory thesis collections are not only from ITB Astronomy students but also students from outside ITB who make Final Projects at Bosscha including Physics Engineering ITS, UI, UPI, UNPAD, UIN, UNILA, UNHAS, UNJ, UNM, etc.

The Bosscha Library also has fairly complete astronomy meeting Proceedings, including The International Astronomical Union and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, namely: IAU Symposium, Highlights of Astronomy, IAU Colloquium , ASP Conference Series and many others.

Although now electronic journals are preferable, Bosscha Observatory still subscribes to hardcopy journals namely ICARUS and JBAA. The Astronomical Almanac which is received from the US Naval Observatory every year becomes a reference for various agencies in Indonesia, because only the Bosscha Observatory has them. Likewise, Hisab and Rukyat (calculation and observation of young crescent moon for hijri calendar) collection becomes a reference for many agencies related to determine first day of Hijri month. Not only books, Bosscha library has photographs, CDs, e-books and e-journals, sky maps, astronomical clippings, etc. The total collection of books owned is around 5000 copies; journals and other publications around 20000 volumes.

## Engineering Workshop Building

Engineering workshops are crucial facilities for research sites such as the Bosscha Observatory. The main task of this place is to make a variety of things, depends on the needs that are tailored to the needs of researchers/observers, e.g. connecting adapters, or telescope holders. It also the place where technicians could tend a broken instruments. The technicians who work are also reliable in carrying out maintenance and repairs of Dutch heritage telescopes such as the Zeiss and Bamberg telescopes.


## Multimedia Building

{{<figure library="1" src="multi.jpg">}}

Multimedia has a capacity of 100 people and currently used for public visits. This room is equipped with multimedia facilities, so besides being used as a popular astronomy lecture for visitors, this room can also be used for screening films/scientific documentation and student activities. On an average day of public visit, this multimedia room provides services for up to 600 people per day.

This Multimedia Room was built in 1934 and was originally intended for public demonstrations. Initially, this room has scientific props, for example eclipse exhibits, sky displays, telescopes miniature, and so on. It is known that Bosscha Observatory has received public visits since 1926. But along with the increasing number of visits, this space was modified into a place for delivering astronomical information. Inside, there is a bronze statue of K.A.R. Bosscha. The statue is a souvenir from the Dutch East Indies Astronomy Association to Bosscha, which was handed over when the Zeiss Telescope were inaugurated in 1928. When the Multimedia Room was completed, the statue was permanently reside inside this building.

Lecture of astronomy is generally given by lecturers and students in the Astronomy Study Program, FMIPA, ITB. Apart from being a place for presentations to the public, this place is also used for lectures in the Astronomy Study Program, ITB.

## Kerkhoven Building

{{<foldergallery src="kerkhoven">}}

The role of Bosscha Observatory as a research and education facility makes Bosscha Observatory often visited by many academics such as students and researchers from other institutions. To ensure the smooth running of their activities, Bosscha Observatory provides overnight facilities. Kerkhoven's house (or house A, some people call it) is usually used as a guest house for them, and it also act as a meeting and workshop venue managed by Bosscha Observatory.
